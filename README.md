# OpenSecrets CRP API
A Python client for the [Center for Responsive Politics API](https://www.opensecrets.org/resources/create/apis.php "OpenSecrets API documentation") at OpenSecrets.org.

Access campaign contribution and personal financial data for US congressional members.

You will need a [Center for Responsive Politics API key](https://www.opensecrets.org/api/admin/index.php?function=signup "OpenSecrets API signup").

## Install
From PyPI:
```
pip install opensecrets-crpapi
```
Or, download and use the install script:
```
git clone https://github.com/robrem/opensecrets-crpapi && cd opensecrets-crpapi
python setup.py install
```

## Usage
All API functions are abstracted to corresponding client methods, and accept the respective parameters. Results are returned in JSON format, and pre-parsed
to trim the fat. For example:
```
>>> from crpapi import CRP
>>> crp = CRP(API_KEY)

# get a specific legislator by CID
>>> cand = crp.candidates.get('N00007360')
>>> cand['@attributes']['lastname']
'PELOSI'

# get the top contributors to a candidate for a specific cycle
>>> contribs = crp.candidates.contrib('N00007360', '2016')
>>> contribs[0]['@attributes']['org_name']
'ActBlue'

# get fundraising information for a committee's members, by industry
>>> cmte = crp.committees.cmte_by_ind('HARM', 'F10')
>>> cmte[0]['@attributes']['member_name']
'Heck, Joe'

# use fetch to access the endpoints more directly, without pre-parsed results
>>> summ = crp.fetch('candSummary', cid='N00007360')
>>> summ['summary']['@attributes']['first_elected']
'1987'
```
